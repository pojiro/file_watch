Automatically run your commands each time you save a file.

Because TDD with [mix test.watch](https://github.com/lpil/mix-test.watch) is awesomeðŸŽ‰

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- On Linux you may need to install [`inotify-tools`](https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools).

config template, .fwatch.exs, will be generated under CWD.
configuration details are described in it.

## Acknowledgment

FileWatch uses or refs the following OSS and so on,

- uses [FileSystem](https://github.com/falood/file_system) for detecting file has been touched
- refs [mix test.watch](https://github.com/lpil/mix-test.watch) for architecture
- refs [Phoenix live-reload](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_reload) for debounce

## Other Info

I didn't know about `fswatch` until I developed FileWatch.
If FileWatch doesn't fit your needs, please check out [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch).
