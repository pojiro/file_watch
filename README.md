# EsWatch

Automatically run your commands each time you save a file.

Because TDD with [mix test.watch](https://github.com/lpil/mix-test.watch) is awesome🎉

## TODO

- [ ] README.md の記述
- [ ] test の実装
- [ ] moduledoc 等の追加
- [ ] ライセンス選択
- [ ] hex publish

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `es_watch` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:es_watch, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/es_watch](https://hexdocs.pm/es_watch).
